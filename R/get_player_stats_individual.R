#' Gets bio information and career statistics for specified player
#'
#' Returns a data frame of players, their bio information (age, birth place, etc.), and career statistics for user supplied player URLs and names.
#'
#' @param ... Function requires a \code{player_url} and \code{name}. Additional data may be supplied. All of this information comes directly from \code{get_player_stats_team()} and \code{get_teams()} or \code{get_drafts()}, if desired.
#' @param progress Sets a Progress Bar. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param strip_redundancy Removes variables \code{name_}, \code{player_url_}, and \code{position_}, as they're the same as \code{name}, \code{player_url}, and \code{position}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @examples
