#' Gets players' stats and URLs for specified team
#'
#' Returns a data frame of players' stats and player URLs for user supplied teams & seasons
#'
#' @param ... Function requires a \code{team_url}, \code{team}, \code{league}, and \code{season}. Additional data may be supplied. All of this information comes directly from \code{get_teams()}, if desired.
#' @param progress Sets a Progress Bar. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @examples
#'
#' # The function works in conjunction with get_teams()
#' teams <- get_teams("ohl", 2018)
#' get_player_stats_team(teams)
#'
#' # All functions are easily pipeable too
#' get_teams(c("shl", "allsvenskan"), 2009:2011) %>%
#'   get_player_stats_team(progress = TRUE)

#' # It's also easy to get player stats for only 1 team
#' get_teams("ncaa iii", 2018) %>%
#'   filter(team == "Hamilton College") %>%
