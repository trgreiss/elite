#' Gets teams and team URLs for specified league and season
#'
#' Returns a data frame of teams and their URLs for user supplied leagues & seasons. Bear in mind that there are some cases in which teams that aren't part of the user-supplied league are returned in the data frame. This is normal and is fixed later when using \code{get_player_stats_team()}.
#'
#' @param league Leagues from which the user wants to scrape data
#' @param season Seasons for which the user wants to scrape data. Must be of the form \code{2018}, \code{1965}, etc. for the 2017-18 and 1964-65 seasons, respectively.
#' @param progress Sets a Progress Bar. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
#' @param ... Allows the user to supply other information to the function. If you don't know what this means, then don't worry about it.
#' @examples
#' get_teams("ohl", 2013)
#'
#' get_teams(c("SHL", "allsvenskan", "ncaa iii"), c(1994, 2017:2018), progress = FALSE)
